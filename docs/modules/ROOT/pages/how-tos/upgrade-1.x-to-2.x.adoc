= Upgrade from 1.x to 2.x

This guide describes the steps to perform an upgrade of the component from version 1.x to 2.x.

== Introduction

Beginning with version 2.0.0, this component is no longer based on the Bitnami Helm chart, but on the official Helm chart for MetalLB.

The upgrade can be done in-place.

You should notice that the Docker image changes from docker.io to quay.io.

We're doing this because we want to be als close to upstream as possible.

Please also keep in mind that we upgraded the version of MetalLB from v0.9.5 to v0.12.1. You can find the full changelog https://metallb.universe.tf/release-notes/[here].
