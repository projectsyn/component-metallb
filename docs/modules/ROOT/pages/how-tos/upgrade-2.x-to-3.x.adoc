= Upgrade from 2.x to 3.x

This guide describes the steps to perform an upgrade of the component from version 2.x to 3.x.

== Introduction

Beginning with version 3.0.0, this component is using the commodore best practices for Helm charts.

This means that the value to manually override the Helm chart version has changed from `parameters.metallb.charts.metallb` to `parameters.metallb.charts.metallb.version`.

Therefore, the following configuration

```
parameters:
  metallb:
    charts:
      metallb: x.y.z
```

must be changed to

```
parameters:
  metallb:
    charts:
      metallb:
        version: x.y.z
```

in order to override the Helm chart version.
